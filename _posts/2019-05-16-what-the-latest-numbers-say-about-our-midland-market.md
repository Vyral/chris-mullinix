What’s been going on in our Midland real estate market lately? Inventory is low and demand is high, which means we’re in a seller’s market. As of the shooting of this video, we have roughly 300 available houses on the market, which equates to 1.5 months’ worth of inventory. This low inventory has caused the median sales price to increase to about $370,000. Interest rates, meanwhile, are hovering between 4.25% and 4.5%, which is higher than where they were last year, but not by much. All in all, due to low interest rates, high demand, and low inventory, it’s a great time to buy or sell.
