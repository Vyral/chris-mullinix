As a home seller, here are the three tips you need to remember if you want to sell quickly and for top dollar:

**1\. Determine a fair asking price.** If you need assistance with this step, call me anytime. I’d be happy to visit your house, do a quick walk-through, and show you the prices of recently sold comparable properties. Together we can come up with a fair asking price for your home.&nbsp;

**2\. Clean and declutter the home.** Your home’s condition is an important factor in determining the success of your sale, so clean and declutter it before you take any professional photos of it. I always recommend hiring a professional cleaning service to work on the home before listing. After that, you can maintain everything yourself. Again, I’d be happy to walk through your home and give a personal consultation as to what work needs to be done to it, whether that means cleaning the carpet, replacing the flooring, etc.&nbsp;

**3\. Determine your marketing strategies.** This is where you’ll have to work with your Realtor to determine the specific selling features your home has to offer. The last thing you want to do is stick a sign in your front yard and hope it sells. Put together a nice, neat, aggressive marketing plan—exactly the kind of thing my team and I specialize in.&nbsp;

If you’d like help selling your home, need to know its value, or have any real estate questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
